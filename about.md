Hey there! I'm vict0ni, a computer science student and an infosec enthusiast, hoping to make a career on the field. Welcome to my blog, where I'll be writing about my journey to the fascinating world of hacking. Of course, some computer science stuff could not miss the party. *Maybe* some math stuff too.

I like playing CTF's and I'm a big fan of [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).
