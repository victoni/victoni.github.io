Hey there! I'm vict0ni, a computer science student and an infosec enthusiast, hoping to make a career on the field. Welcome to my blog, where I'll be writing about my journey to the fascinating world of computers. I'm mostly interested in bug bounties, pentesting, CTFs and programming. Of course any interesting CS-related article may pop-up.
